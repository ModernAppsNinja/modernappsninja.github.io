### About Course

This course provides a technical introduction to VMware Tanzu Standard edition, including vSphere with Tanzu, Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, and Tanzu Mission Control. 

While the focus of this course is Tanzu Standard edition, it also includes coverage of all features included in Tanzu Basic Edition, including a review of the differences between Tanzu Basic and Standard editions. 

### Requirements

We recommend taking the Introduction to VMware Tanzu Portfolio course prior to taking the Intro to VMware Tanzu Standard course.

This course assumes familiarity with Kubernetes and Cloud Native Technologies. If you are not familiar with these technologies, we recommend checking out [KubeAcademy](https://kube.academy/courses) by VMware, which has a terrific set of free, bite-size video resources on the basics of containers, Kubernetes and cloud native that are great for beginners.

Before taking this course, you should also have familiarity with vSphere administration. If you need additional background in vSphere, we recommend checking out [VMware Hands-on Labs](https://labs.hol.vmware.com/HOL/catalogs/catalog/1887), which offers a number of vSphere labs and content.
